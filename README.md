# api-image-search-page
I created a similar API Image Search Project for my bootcamp techdegree. I wanted to revisit this project to try a different API - this one with Unsplash is free like Flickr which was what I used before - yet unlike Flickr, you do not have to enter a personalized key AND the secret- you can just enter your key which makes programming easier and for user, is one less step!

For non-technical viewers: 
To run this program right click, choose LIVE SERVER from the menu, and voila - the rendering will appear. 
Enter any image you would like to see in the search bar then click SEARCH and the images will appear.
